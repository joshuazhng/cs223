# Collaboration
I did not discuss my solution for this PSET with any peers.

# Discussion
The most challenging part of the coding process for this PSET was debugging an error in which my grop executable would not print the full path to the file before the file name. The error that I needed to resolve was that I was only passing the file name to parse_file, but I needed to instead pass both the path and the file name to parse_file in the build_index function. Throughout the coding process, another challenging aspect was the need to understand the hashing process and how each individual function contributed played a role.
