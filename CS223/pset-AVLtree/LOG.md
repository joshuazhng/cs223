# Collaboration
I did not discuss my solution for this PSET with any peers.

# Discussion
The most challenging part of the coding process for this PSET was understanding the algorithm of the AVL tree. Due to some misunderstandings, some errors in the code created bugs and caused the output to be incorrect. In particular, recognizing that the height of the node must be -1 if the node is null was a crucial part of implementing the program that I missed at first. However, as a whole, the functions were not too challenging once I was able to understand the objective of what my program should do.
