# Collaboration
I did not discuss my solution for this PSET with any peers.

# Discussion
I had a few bugs in my code that caused me to get stuck during the coding process at various points, which made the process more challenging. However, overall, I found this PSET to be difficult but manageable. The print function in LinkedList.cpp was especially hard to debug as I wasn't very familiar with the syntax for printing in C++. In various functions, such as the makeEmpty function, I also forgot to take into account the adjustment of the variables in the LinkedList struct such as length, currPos, and head. The function getNextStation also proved to be rather difficult as there are a few possibilities and edge cases you must take into account, but I was able to find fixes for these issues by running the local tester.
